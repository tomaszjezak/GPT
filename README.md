The Transformer model, designed for character-level text generation, consists of embeddings, positional encodings, and 4 Transformer blocks, totaling 10.78 million parameters. Over 5000 iterations, it learns to predict subsequent characters, capturing the essence of Shakespearean text. Periodic evaluations every 500 iterations show a steady decrease in loss, indicating the model's improving proficiency in generating stylistically similar text. The final output showcases the model's ability to produce coherent and stylistically resonant Shakespearean language.
